# TODAY'S CODE !!!




# ==============================================


# DIVISION RELATED OPERATIONS
# write a program to print the answer after division

a = 42
b = 9
print(a / b)


# write a program to print the remainder after division

a = 42
b = 9
print(a % b) #remainder after division

# write a program to print the quotient after division
a = 42
b = 9
print(a // b) #quotient after division



# USE OF INPUT FUNCTION
# write a program to take input from user print the remainder after division
num1 = int(input("Please Enter the 1st no")) #converting string to int
num2 = int(input("Please Enter the 2nd no"))  #converting string to int

r = num1 % num2
print(r)

# USE OF COMPARISON OPERATOR
# write a program to take input from user and check if it is even or odd

num1 = int(input("Please Enter the 1st no"))
r = num1 % 2
print(r==0)
